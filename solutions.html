				Right now, there are many important problems in the world. Here are some possible ways to diminish poverty.
			</p>
			<p>

				- The UN or any other organisation should provide people in need medical help, resources such as food, building materials. <br>
				- People don't have stable jobs to provide them with money for a normal life. <br>
				- We should make it our goal to educate all the people in developing countries to help them find stable jobs and decrease the amount of unemployement.
