				<p>Globally, the number of people living in extreme poverty declined from 36% in 1990 to 10% in 2015. Ever since 2015, the UN has done this, made lots of progress and did this
				</p>
				<p>
				But the Covid-19 global pandemic has been cancelling the progress that the UN and other organisations made. Many people have lost their jobs because of the lockdown, which made 4 million people live at or below $1,25 per day.
				</p>
				<p>
				Due to Covid we have lost around 4 years of progress - this means that we have to act immediately to achieve the sustainable development goal by 2035
